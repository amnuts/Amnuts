There is blood on the walls, blood on the floors and the stale stench of
death.  You see carcasses on the floor and realize that there have been
many battles fought here.  Even through the stench you find your mind
wandering away, imagining how wonderful it would be to have there boss
here right now so that you can take your own shots at 'em.
