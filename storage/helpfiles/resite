~OLCommand :~RS resite
~OLUsage   :~RS resite <user>|-a

If you are running the ident daemon then this command will allow you
to get the site of the given user again. This is useful if the ident
daemon was not running at the time they logged in. If you use the -a
option then it will get the sites of all the users logged on.
