~OLCommand :~RS dump
~OLUsage   :~RS dump -u|-r <level>|-c|-m|-s

This command allows you to dump talker information directly to files on
the talker shell account. If you use the -u option you will dump all the
users names. If you use the -r <level> option then you will dump only
the users with that level. If you use the -c option then you will dump
the last 16 commands used. -m dumps the memory currently being used by
the talker, and -s dumps system information such as PID, netlink and IP
resolve status, and more.
