~OLCommand :~RS arrest
~OLUsage   :~RS arrest <user>

Sends the given user to jail (if there is an allocated jail room) and
sets their level to JAILED. If the users logs off and then back on they
will remain JAILED and be sent automatically to jail room. If no jail
room is allocated then they will remain in the main room, although be
JAILED. The user does not have to be online to be arrested. The arrest
is level based, in that if an ARCH arrests someone then only an ARCH or
higher can unarrest them. The arresting level is displayed in the ustat.
