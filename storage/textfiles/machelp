+----- Macro Usage ----------------------------------------------------------+

Macros are an easy way to type out something that you might use very often.
Currently you have 10 macros that you can use, and they can be displayed by
using the "macros" command.

This documentation assumes you are in SAY mode.

~FCHow to enter a macro
To set a macros you have to first chose which 'slot' it has to go into.  A
'slot' is represented by a number and an = sign, for example 1=
Once you have done this then you can enter whatever you want to have as the
macro into that slot.  And to do that you would type:

    .<slot number>=<whatever you want to have as the macro>

And example of this would be:

    ~FG.1= Hello and welcome to the talker!  How are you?

When the macro is used you would then say "Hello and welcome to the talker!
How are you?".  But the macro does not have to be restricted to just things to
say, as you can also enter commands, or abbreviations into the slot.

For example:  ~FG.1=;smiles~RS happily would result in: ~FG<name> smiles happily

To remove a macro from your list all you have to do is enter a blank macro.
For example, to remove the macro from slot 1 you would type:  ~FG.1=

~FCHow to use a macro
You use a macro simply by entering it's slot number.  So to use slot 1 you
would type: ~FG.1
