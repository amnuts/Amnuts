~OLCommand :~RS mode
~OLUsage   :~RS mode

This switches you between speech mode and command mode. In speech mode
everything you type is interpreted as speech unless it is preceded by
a dot. In command mode you get a standard command type or prompt and
everything is treated as a command, to talk you must explicitly use the
"say" command.
