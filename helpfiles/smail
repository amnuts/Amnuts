~OLCommand :~RS smail
~OLUsage   :~RS smail <user>[@<service>] [<text>]

Allows you to send mail to a user (possibly a remote talker via a netlink
service if your talker is currently connected to it). If you omit the
text then you will be put into the line editor and allowed to enter you
message that way. This is recommended if you have a lot you want to write.
