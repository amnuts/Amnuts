~OLCommand :~RS demote
~OLUsage   :~RS demote <user> [<level>]

Will demote a user to the next level down in the ranks list. You cannot
demote below the lowest level, and you cannot demote anyone of the same
or higher level as you. You can also demote a user even if they are not
logged on. If the <level> option is used then the user will be demoted
directly to that given level, rather than the level below what they
currently are.
