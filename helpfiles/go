~OLCommand :~RS go
~OLUsage   :~RS go [<room>] | [<service>] [<password>]

This command moves you to another room, providing that room is adjoined
and is not set to private (unless you have been invited into that room).
If you omit the room name you will be moved straight to the main room
(i.e., that room which you start in).
