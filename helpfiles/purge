~OLCommand :~RS purge
~OLUsage   :~RS purge -d
~OL        :~RS purge -s <site>
~OL        :~RS purge -t <days>

This gives you a manual way of purging user files. If the "-d" option is
used then a purge will be conducted with the default time settings. If
the "-s" option is used then anyone from the <site> supplied will be
purged. If the "-t" option is used then anyone who last logged on more
that <days> ago will be purged.

A purge is automatically done when the talker is booted if the auto_purge
option is active, and also every time the default non-use time period
has expired (take taken from after boot-up time).

CAUTION: With a purge the system may be temporarily lagged.
