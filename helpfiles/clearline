~OLCommand :~RS clearline
~OLUsage   :~RS clearline <line>

It is possible to clear the line of a user whilst they are in the login
stage (as shown on "people"). This is useful if that line has been stuck
in the login stage for too long, or you want to clear the line quickly
before the user logs in.
