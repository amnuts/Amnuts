~OLCommand :~RS minlogin
~OLUsage   :~RS minlogin -a|-n|<level>

This sets the minimum login level of a user that can log in. This directly
affects the main port but only affects the wizport if it is set higher
than the wizport login level. If set to -a all login attempts on the
main port will be refused. If set to -n then anyone can log in and new
users can be created. If set to <level> no new accounts can be created
but users of level <level> and above can still log in.
