~OLCommand :~RS promote
~OLUsage   :~RS promote <user> [<level>]

Will promote a user to the next level up in the ranks list. You cannot
promote above the highest level, and you cannot promote anyone of the
same or higher level as you. You can also promote a user even if they
are not logged on. If the <level> option is used then the user will be
promoted directly to that given level, rather than the level above what
they currently are.
