~OLCommand :~RS hangman
~OLUsage   :~RS hangman start|stop|status

This will allow you to start or stop a game of hangman, and also to see
the status of your current game. If you use the "start" option, then a
new game of hangman will be started (if you are not currently in a game)
with a random word. Use the "guess" command to guess a letter in the word.
