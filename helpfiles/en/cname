~OLCommand :~RS cname
~OLUsage   :~RS cname <old-user> <new-user>

This command allows you to change the name of an existing user to another
name. This will allow users to be able to change their name if they wish
without creating a new account, gain their logon time back, redo their
profile, lose their mail, etc. The user does not have to be logged on
for you to be able to use the command on them, though it works even if
they are.
