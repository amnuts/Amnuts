This will allow you verify that you have been sent an email from the
talker. You will be sent this when you set your email address using
the "set" command (providing you specify a correct email address).
Once you get the email you will have a verification code which you must
supply before you can have local mail forwarded to your email address.
Use the "set" command to turn on or off auto-forwarding. Use the "fmail"
command to manually forward select local mail.
