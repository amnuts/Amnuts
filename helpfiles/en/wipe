~OLUsage   :~RS wipe <message>

~OL        :~RS wipe all

This command allows you to delete messages from the board of the room
that you are in. You can delete specific single messages by supplying
just a number, or from the first message to a given number. You can
also delete from a certain message to another message, or you can delete
all the board. If a given number to delete to is higher than the actual
amount of message on the board, then all the messages will be deleted.
If you are in your personal room (if this function is currently active)
then you can wipe any message, regardless of who posted it.
