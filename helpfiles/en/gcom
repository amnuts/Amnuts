~OLCommand :~RS gcom
~OLUsage   :~RS gcom <user> [<command>]

This enables you to give usage of a command to the <user> given that they
would not normally have. If the <command> option is not used then it
will display any commands that the user has been given access to. This
works as a toggle, so that if the <command> is not already listed for
the user then they will gain access to it else the access will be removed.
