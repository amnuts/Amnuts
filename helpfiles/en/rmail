~OLCommand :~RS rmail
~OLUsage   :~RS rmail [new|<message>]

If the option "new" is used then you will read only those messages that
have been sent to you since you last checked your mailbox. If a message
number is given then you will be shown only that message, otherwise any
mail that you currently have in your mailbox. Message numbers can be
checked using the "from" command.
