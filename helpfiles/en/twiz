~OLCommand :~RS twiz
~OLUsage   :~RS twiz [<level>] <text>

This command allows the Wiz to tell to various Wiz levels though they
can only specifically tell to levels equal or less that of their own.
If no level is specified it defaults to WIZ which means all the Wiz
levels can hear it. Example of tell to all ARCHs: .twiz arch hiya!
