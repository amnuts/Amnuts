~OLCommand :~RS myroom
~OLUsage   :~RS myroom [-d]

This command allows you to move into your own personal room. If your
room does not exist then it will create one for you automatically. You
may set your own room description, topic and also have your own personal
message board. If the "-d" option is used then your room will be deleted.
The personal rooms function must be active to use this command.
