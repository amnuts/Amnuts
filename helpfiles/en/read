~OLCommand :~RS read
~OLUsage   :~RS read [<room>] [<message>]

This displays the message board of the given room, providing you have
access to that room (i.e., it is not fixed to private). If no room is
given it defaults to your current room. If you use the <message> option,
then you will read only that specific message number for the room given,
or the room you are in if no room name is supplied.
