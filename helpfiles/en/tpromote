~OLCommand :~RS tpromote
~OLUsage   :~RS tpromote <user> [<level>]

Will promote a user temporarily to the next level up in the ranks
list. This promotion will only last as long as the user is logged
on. Once they log out they will be returned to their normal level. You
cannot promote above the highest level, and you cannot promote anyone
of the same or higher level as you. You can also tpromote a user even if
they are logged on. If the <level> option is used then the user will be
promoted directly to that given level, rather than the level above that
which they currently are.
