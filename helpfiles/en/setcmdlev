~OLCommand :~RS setcmdlev
~OLUsage   :~RS setcmdlev <command> <level>|norm

With this command you can alter the level of a command for the time that
the talker is active. (i.e., if you reboot or shutdown the talker then
the command will revert back to its normal level). If you give the option
"norm" then you will revert the command back to its normal level. You
can only alter the levels of commands you have access to.
