~OLCommand :~RS charecho
~OLUsage   :~RS charecho

This is a command that is only of use to people who use character
mode clients. Some of these clients will not echo the characters input
themselves even when told to do so; this command forces the talker to
do it instead. The command is a toggle so using it will alternately
flick the echoing on and off. If you switch echoing on even when your
client is echoing you will see every character twice.
