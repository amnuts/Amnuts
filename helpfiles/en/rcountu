~OLCommand :~RS rcountu
~OLUsage   :~RS rcountu

This command allows you to re-check the nodes in the complete linked list
of users to see if any should be added or removed, and also check the
recorded levels of users. This would mainly be used if you had manually
altered the user files, or added any file or deleted them.
