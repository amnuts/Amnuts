~OLUsage   :~RS search <word> [<word>...]

This will search for the words in the word list in all of the message
boards that you could possibly see. i.e., it wont show you anything from
boards that are in rooms fixed to private if you do not have access to
those rooms. The word search is done on an OR basis, ie if any of the
words are in a given message it will be shown as opposed to all of the
words having to be there.
