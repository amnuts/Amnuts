~OLCommand :~RS ewiz
~OLUsage   :~RS ewiz [<level>] <text>

This command allows one to emote to various staff levels though they
can only specifically emote to levels equal or less that of their own.
If no level is specified it defaults to lowest staff level which means
all staff levels can hear it. Example of emoting to all staff of ARCH
or above: .ewiz arch grins.
