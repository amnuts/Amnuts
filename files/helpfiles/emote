Emotes allow you to express emotions. A example would be "Andy feels sad".
If you were logged in as Andy you would enter ".emote feels sad" and your
user name will be prefixed to the front. The result is seen in the room
you are currently in. You may also use a leading apostrophe to produce
results such as: "Andy's face breaks into a grin".
