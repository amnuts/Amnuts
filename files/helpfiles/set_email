~OLCommand :~RS set email
~OLUsage   :~RS set email [<email>]

This setting takes your email address, and places it in your userfile for
use in local mail to email autoforwarding (if system allows), and will
show in the .ustat command depending on if you have also used ".set hide"
to hide your email address from other users.

Using this command alone will clear your email setting. Setting your
email will send you a short form letter to the set email address,
that will include a verification code to use with the .verify command.
Your email address MUST be verified with this code to be able to use
the forwarding if the talker allows.

Your email address is kept hidden by default. See ".help set hide"
for more details.
