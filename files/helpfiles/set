~OLCommand :~RS set
~OLUsage   :~RS set [<attribute> [<property>]]

Allows you to set certain attributes that will be shown when someone
uses the "ustat" command on you. By omitting the <attribute> you will
display the current settings of your attributes, and also a description
of what the attributes mean. Some attributes are a toggle between on
and off, and others require you entering a <property>. Use ".set show"
to show what attributes you are able to change via the set command. You
can also see detailed info by using ".help set show" for the list of
other help files for the set command.
