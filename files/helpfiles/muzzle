~OLUsage   :~RS muzzle <user>

Muzzles a user which prevents them speaking, shouting, emoting and
mailing other people. The muzzle levels are based upon the user level
of whoever muzzled the user. If an ARCH muzzles a user, for instance,
the user can be unmuzzled by any ARCH or GOD, if however he is muzzled
by a GOD then only another GOD can unmuzzle him.
