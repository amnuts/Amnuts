This command allows you to delete messages from your mailbox. You
can delete specific single messages by supplying just a number, or
from the first message to a given number. You can also delete from a
certain message to another message, or you can delete all your mail.
If a given number to delete to is higher than the actual amount of mail
in your mailbox, then all the mail will be deleted.
