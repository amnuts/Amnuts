~OLCommand :~RS rloadrm
~OLUsage   :~RS rloadrm -a|<room>

With this you can reload room descriptions should you need to. This
command would generally be used if the room description file had been
altered and you wanted to implement the changes (e.g., spelling mistakes
corrected) without rebooting the talker. If the "-a" option is used then
all room descriptions will be reloaded, else just the description for
the room supplied. This will not effect personal rooms.
