This command is to aid management of personal rooms for admins. If you
use the "-l" option then it will list all personal rooms currently active
on the talker with some information about each room. If the "-m" option
is used then it will display the amount of memory the personal rooms is
currently using. If the "-u" option is used together with a name of a
user then it will unload that user's personal room from memory. If the
"-d" option is used with a name, then it will unload that user's personal
room from memory and delete all associated room files (message board,
room description, etc.).
