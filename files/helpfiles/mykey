~OLCommand :~RS mykey
~OLUsage   :~RS mykey [<user>]

This command allows you to give specific users access to your personal
room even though you may have it locked. If you omit the <user> attribute
then it will list all users you have given keys to. The <user> does not
have to be online for you to give them a key. This command also works
like a toggle, in that if you have given a user a key you use this
command again with their name to remove that key.
