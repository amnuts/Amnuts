~OLCommand :~RS switch
~OLUsage   :~RS switch [<room>]

This allows you to swap places with one of your clones in the given room.
It saves you destroying the current clone, creating another in your
current room then moving yourself to the old clones room. If you only have
one clone active then you can omit the room name to switch with the clone.
