~OLCommand :~RS swban
~OLUsage   :~RS swban

This toggles a ban on swearing on and off or to a minimum level. If the
swear ban is off, then the user can say anything. If the swear ban is
set to minimum, then any swear words that the user says will be blanked
out with whatever word is hard coded into the talker code. If the swear
ban is set to off then the user will not be able to say anything if it
has a swear word in it.
