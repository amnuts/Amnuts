This command allows you to delete suggestions from the suggestions board.
You can delete specific single suggestions by supplying just a number,
or from the first suggestion to a given number. You can also delete from
a certain suggestion to another suggestion, or you can delete all the
board. If a given number to delete to is higher than the actual amount
of suggestions on the board, then all the suggestions will be deleted.
