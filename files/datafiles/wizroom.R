The portal to the real world shimmers and vibrates.  The dark blue oval
shapes looks right at home here in the room, with it's strange containers
on dusty shelves.  On the heavy-set desk there are many weighty books
inscribed with a language not of this, or any earthly world.  Occasionally
one of the mysterious items in the jars gurgles or winks at you
coquettishly.  This makes you sick to your stomach, but you're glad for the
attention - even if it is from a... splodge, swimming around in it's own
mucus.
