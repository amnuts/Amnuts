The room stretches out much like the car park.  You notice, however, that
there is a room in one corner made of glass which you correctly guess is
the bosses room, for only they could be paranoid enough to need to look
out all the time.  You hear friendly talking and look around to the other
people... playing computer games and reading newspapers.  You are happy to
witness such dedication to the art of schiving off work.
