Thinking that no room could be colder than the store room you find
yourself in a mild state of shock.  The spiders are skiing down the snow,
the woodlice have been building snowmen and the flies are having a
friendly snow ball fight.  Cold does not describe it.  Cold and Messy
pretty much does though.
