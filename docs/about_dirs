       DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
     Directory information for the Unix talker code Amnuts
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The server has a fixed directory structure and expects certain files to be
in certain directories which I shall describe below...


datafiles
---------

This directory contains the config file which contains all the parameters
necessary to boot the server and also the room description and message
board files. These are in the form of <room name>.R and <room name>.B
respectively.  It also expects to find the map files in this directory, of
the form <map name>.map.

Also the 2 ban files: sitebans and userbans are stored here which store
banned sites and banned users.

There is another directory in here, 'old_datafiles', just in case any of you
wanted the old rooms and config files.


helpfiles
---------

This contains all the help files. 'Nuff said really.


userfiles
---------

The root of userfiles contains the .D files - the user information.
There is also a sub-structure of directories which are as follows:

   flagged   : List of flagged users (.U)
   historys  : History of user events (.H)
   mail      : User's mail files (.M)
   macros    : Any macros the user has set (.MAC)
   profiles  : Profiles is the user has made them (.P)
   rooms     : Stores the user's room information (.R), rooms board
               information (.B)
   xgcoms    : Any commands the user has been restricted from using of
               given access to (.C)
   reminders : Stores reminder message and date (.REM)


mailspool
---------

This is where mail to other linked talkers is temporarily spooled ready
to be sent off or while it is being received.

Outgoing mail filenames are in the format of: OUT_<from>_<to>@<service to>

eg OUT_Bod_Andy@talker2

Incoming ones are: IN_<to>_<from>@<service_from>

eg IN_Andy_Bod@talker1


pictfiles
---------

Contains ASCII pictures that are used on the talker with the commands
"picture", "preview" and "ptell".  The pictures can contain colour codes
if you want.


miscfiles
---------

This contains any files that could not be classed into the other
directories.  I suppose they could all have been put into 'datafiles', but
I personally like to use that just for room data and talker configuration..
But maybe that's just me?


motds
-----

This contains the further directories:

	- motd1
	- motd2

Each of those contain the pre- and post-login motds.  You can have as many
as you like, providing you have AT LEAST ONE in there.  They are named
consecutively, such as 'motd1', 'motd2', 'motd3', etc.  They MUST be called
this.


logfiles
--------

This contains the system logs and crash logs.  Each log file has the PID
for that session and the date as an extension.


dumpfiles
---------

This directory will only contain items if you use the 'dump' command on
the talker.


textfiles
---------

This contains the further directory:

	- adminfiles

This is where files for the 'files' and 'adminfiles' commands reside.

reboot
------

This directory contains any temporary files created by the seamless reboot
functions.
