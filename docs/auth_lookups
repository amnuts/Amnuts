                      Information about Auth lookups
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This version gives you the remote port number of the user connected to the 
talker via the .site and .examine commands and is also stored in the syslog
as well as following the SIGN ON: when seen by wizzes and above.
The reason I have done this is so manual user identity lookups can be done on 
a site if you so desire (automatic lookups means lots of extra code) to 
supposedly verify a users real identity though bear in mind that fake auth 
daemons can be easily written (about 2 hours work I'd say for an experienced 
tcp/ip C programmer starting from scratch).
To do a manual lookup telnet to port 113 on the users site (if you get a 
connection refused message they don't have an auth daemon running) and enter 
the following:

<their local port number>,<talkers port number>

So for instance if they're logging in on the talkers main port on 7000 and
their site is sad.hackers.org and local port is 1234 enter:

1234,7000

You should see something like the following:

$ telnet sad.hackers.org 113
Trying sad.hackers.org...
Connected to sad.hackers.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
1234,7000                                <--- Your input
1234 , 7000 : USERID : UNIX : weenie     <--- The reply
Connection closed by foreign host.

As you can see the final field is the user id but if you see this...

1234 , 7000 : ERROR : NO-USER

then something is wrong. Bear in mind that this will only work while the user
is logged onto the talker so if you wish to do it do it quick! Also YOU MUST 
TELNET FROM THE SAME MACHINE THAT THE TALKER IS RUNNING ON. There ends the 
lesson on manual auth lookups. If you're wondering whether I'll put automatic
lookups in future NUTS releases (assuming there'll be any) the answer is no
as the majority of sites do not have auth daemons in the first place eg a
windows PC is very unlikely to have one :) so the effort would not be worth
it , besides doing the lookup could hang the talker if there's net lag.
