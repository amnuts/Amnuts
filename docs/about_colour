            Information about colour and the embedded colour commands
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The colour within the talker as its shipped is set up to look good on a
white text on black background type of terminal/xterm eg the Linux console.
If you're using a black text on white background (ie a crap xterm) then the
colour scheme may not look so good. Tough :) You'll have to change it yourself.

Colour commands can be placed in any string in the program that is used
eventually by write_user() and also in any file that is paged by the more()
function (except MOTD1 as colours can't be used here in case the user's terminal
doesn't support them). The commands get translated into ANSI codes by these 2 
functions before the strings are sent out. Bear in mind that if you're on a 
black and white or green screen terminal all you'll get is various shades of 
grey/green instead of colours (if you get anything at all). All the commands 
start with a ~ and are the following:

~RS - reset terminal to default colour status
~RV - reverse video
~OL - bold
~LI - blink/flash text (only the text flashes , not the background colour). 
	This won't work on all terminals , some xterms simply set it to bold.
~UL - underline text, this doesn't work on all terminals.

~FK - set foreground colour to black
~FR - foreground red
~FG - green
~FY - yellow (though it looks an orange-brown on some systems)
~FB - blue
~FM - magenta/purple
~FC - cyan/bright blue
~FW - white

~BK - set background colour to black
~BR - red
~BG - green
~BY - yellow
~BB - blue
~BM - magenta
~BC - cyan
~BW - white

So if for instance you wanted some flashing magenta "hello" on a green
background followed by a non-flashing blue "world" on a black background you 
would do the following:

write_user(user,"~FM~LI~BGhello ~RS~FBworld\n");

Notice the use of the reset (RS) to reset the background to black and the text
to non-flashing (assuming you're using a white text on black screen VDU). Also 
note that an automatic reset is sent whenever a \0 or \n is encountered in a 
string so the colours set to do not carry over to the next line.

Colour commands can be used within the talker as a user as well as in the code
so for instance you can embed them in anything you say or shout , in your
description , board messages , mail etc ... so to use the above example as
some mail you would enter...

.smail fred ~FM~LI~BGhello ~RS~FBworld

Please note however that the colour commands contribute to the length of
the string so for instance if you put in lots of colour in your description
you may find that it tells you that its too long even if it seems to you that
the actual text is rather short. There is a way around this but its tricky to
program and I can't be bothered to do it. Deal with it :)

You can print out colour commands as themselves by prefixing them with an
additional tilde symbol '~'. For example:

write_user(user,"~~FMtest\n");

This would print out '~FMtest' to the screen minus the extra tilde symbol
('~').  The tilde symbol can also be used online in the talker commands.

*** REMEMBER ***

Not everyone's terminal supports ANSI colour codes. It'll either ignore
them or will produce some very strange effects. Bear this in mind if you
decide to set the user colour default to ON.
