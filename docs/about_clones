              Information about the clones used in Amnuts
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Clones allow a user (who is of sufficient level to use clones) to be in two
different rooms at once.  The clone will allow that user to listen in on the
conversation or add to it by speaking or emoting, much as a normal user would.
The clone commands are as follows:

clone     : creates a clone in the current room or the name of the room you
          : supply.

switch    : switches you between your current object and one of your clone
          : objects.

chear     : clones send what they hear to their owner but this can be set to 
          : return either all the conversation in their room, only that with
          : swearing or nothing at all (just to be a presence there).

csay      : makes a clone say something.

cemote    : makes a clone emote something.

myclones  : lets you see all the clones that you have created and what rooms
            they are in.

allclones : lets you see all the clones currently active on the talker.

destroy   : destroys your clone, or a clone in the given room (or even the clone
            of someone else if you have enough permissions to do this.)
