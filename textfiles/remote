+----- Remote Talkers -------------------------------------------------------+

A new and exciting feature of any talker based on NUTS 3 (and above) code
(Neil Robertson, 1996) is that it can be linked up with other talkers that use
the same code.  In this way you will be able to just 'walk' onto another
talker if it is linked up.
If you see a room with a * next to its name then this indicates that it is a
remote talker linked up.  And you can simply walk onto that talker using the
"go" command.  This saves you having to quit one talker, find the address for
the other talker and then log onto it.
Once you are on the remote talker you will be using the commands of that
talker, which might mean you no longer have certain command that are found on
this talker, or the commands on the remote talker act in a different way.
To get back to the talker you started from, your home talker, you simply use
the "home" command.
So how do you know if there are remote users on the talker that you are on?
When using "who" may see a @ next to the persons name, this indicates that 
they are remote users.
You can smail a remote user on another talker (providing it is link to the
talker you are on) by smailing to their name @ their talker, for example,
smail andy@another_talker.
When you are on a remote system it may take a little while to get adjusted to
the way that talker works and the commands it uses, but it is worth it in the
end.
