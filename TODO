Okay, the infamous TODO list...

Get the ident code working properly (different host binaries)

Add the pager code
	- fix the 1-extra line bug

New smail method - make sure to retro read the old smail version and convert
	- failing that, write a perl script to do it which people will have to run

New message board method - like smail

Add new command 'stopcommand' (or whatever) to stop a command being used by
anyone.

Add a boxing feature using grab_len and center_string to box (and align) over multiple lines

Move commands fully into linked list.
	- save soundex codes in the linked list structure
	- save status (on/off) of command
	- save normal level of command
	- save temp level of the command
	- possibly save function pointer
	- look into saving command states during reboot

Use function pointers for commands ;)
