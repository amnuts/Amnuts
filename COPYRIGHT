Optional Original Copyright for Amnuts code
-------------------------------------------

The Amnuts code and files contain within the distribution are supplied
as freeware and not public domain.  I retain the copyright for all files
included with exception of: the ASCII picture files and any unmodified
documentation written by Neil Robertson.  I will take legal action against
anyone/company who is found selling the code for their own commercial
advantage, though if anyone wishes to run a pay-to-use talker using the
Amnuts code then they are welcome.  If you wish to distribute the original
Amnuts code to anyone else this must be done with my express permission.

You are free to modify the Amnuts code anyway you wish to suit your
own needs and distribute that.  You must not alter the .version, or the
version prompt when logging in so much that it does not refer to the code
being based on Amnuts or that the code isn't 100% original.  You must
also leave the credits from Neil and myself in the code (viewed by '.help
credits'), and also the header information at the top of the source code.

Although every care has been taken to produce a bug-free talker system,
this distribution is supplied as-is and I cannot be held responsible
for damages incurred through any use of the Amnuts code or any other
associated files.  This copyright pertains to ANY version of Amnuts,
documents, or web site.  If you have any problems with this copyright
notice then you should not use the code at all.
