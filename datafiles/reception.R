The sound of people hard at work fills the room.... Not this room,
obviously, but a room at a place similar to this, I'm sure.  Here you can
just hear the general chatter of the day, the shouts and laughter of
people doing generally bugger all.  Occasionally a phone will ring and
someone will grudgingly pick it up, but only after trying to get others to
answer it first.  All in all, you find this isn't a bad place to be.
