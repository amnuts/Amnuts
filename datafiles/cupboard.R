It's dark in here and as you enter you're sure someone locks the door
behind you.  There is a faint sound of muffled laughter to be heard out
side of this room.  To add torture to the experience of being jailed in
the cupboard your boss has left you a 'to-do' list which they want
completed.  A small tape-recorder activates automatically every so often;
it's the boss, disturbing you and adding more items to your list just as
you're trying to work through them...
