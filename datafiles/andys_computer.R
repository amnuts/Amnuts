Walking behind Andy you notice that he is hard at work programming and
creating web pages.  He turns around and breathe a sigh of relief as he
notices you're not the boss.  A few quick taps on the keyboard and the
screen on his computer changes.  It's still a program and web page he's
working on, but that sure as hell doesn't look like anything relating to
what he's being paid for!
